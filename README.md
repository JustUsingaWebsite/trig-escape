## 🌊 The Premise
You control a determined fish trying to escape a dangerous mathematical sea. The catch? Your movement path is defined by **real trigonometric functions** that you customize before each run. Meanwhile, the obstacles transform using random mathematical operations, creating ever-changing challenges.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **🧮 Live Function Visualization** - Watch your chosen trig function draw itself in real-time as you adjust parameters
- **🌀 Shape-Shifting Obstacles** - Enemies mutate using random transformations (phase shifts, amplitude changes, etc.)
- **🎚️ Precision Controls** - Fine-tune your function's properties with interactive sliders
- **🌌 Dynamic Audio Landscape** - Original soundtrack that crossfades between tense gameplay and serene menus
- 💥 **Cinematic Fail States** - Screen shakes, red alerts, and dramatic retry sequences

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Choose Your Function**  
   Start by selecting your mathematical path: Sine, Cosine, or Tangent waves

2. **Tweak Your Equation**  
   Adjust parameters in real-time:
   - *Amplitude* = Wave height 📏  
   - *Frequency* = Wave density 🌊  
   - *Phase* = Horizontal shift ↔️  
   - *Vertical Shift* = Up/down positioning ⬆️⬇️  

3. **Launch Your Run**  
   Hit START and watch your fish ride the function curve!

4. **Survive the Transformations**  
   Avoid obstacles that randomly alter their:  
   - Vertical position 📉  
   - Wave properties (amplitude/frequency)  
   - Phase alignment 🔄  

5. **Reach the Golden Flag**  
   Navigate through 4 transforming obstacles to win!

## ⚠️ Danger Zones
- **Spike Clusters** - Instant reset on contact ❌
- **Edge Overflow** - Falling off the screen ends your run 🌊
- **Function Mismatch** - Poor parameter choices create impossible paths 🤯

## 🕹️ Controls
**Desktop**  
- `Mouse` - Adjust sliders | Click buttons  
- `Spacebar` - Quick restart (post-failure)  

**Mobile**
